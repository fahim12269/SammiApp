# Calories Recorder (Expo)

This is an Expo Router app for tracking nutrition with a modern, bubbly UI.

Quick start

```bash
npm i # or yarn / pnpm
npm run start # press i for iOS simulator or a for Android
```

Tabs
- History: calendar + day summary modal (same board as dashboard)
- Add Entry: preset meals, add another meal, stored locally (AsyncStorage)
- Dashboard: progress board + breakdown bars
- Goal Setting: set daily goals

Note: Backend is local-only for now. Firebase will be integrated later for persistence/sync.
